# Discontinued
This project is/should have been a collection of several utilities for windows computers.

This includes:
- A password manager
- Extended clipboard
- Stopwatch
- Timer
- etc...

The password manager is actually working relatively well for my first real C# project, but it's not very secure. I wouldn't suggest to use this password manager for real data taht has te be keep secure!

# The Original Readme:
